### What we do
Birga provides a unified integration layer so your applications can talk to R-Keeper, Poster, and other POS systems through a single, consistent interface. We handle protocols, retries, and mapping so you can focus on your product.

### Why it matters
Multiple POS integrations mean duplicated logic, different APIs, and maintenance overhead. Birga centralizes connectivity, reduces integration time, and makes it easy to add new POS providers as you grow.

### Built for scale
Our gateway is designed for reliability and observability. We support modern auth, retries, and health checks out of the box.

### Connect once, reach many
We integrate with leading point-of-sale and delivery platforms. Connect once and reach many.
