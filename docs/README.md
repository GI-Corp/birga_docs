# Introduction

You can integrate your business with the Birga Gateway API, for example:

- **Synchronization of menu, orders, payments between Birga Gateway and your application**. You can use the online orders API to send orders from the website to the register. The location cashier will process and accept an order, and all reports will be available in Birga Gateway. 
- **Special reports in the management console**. If you need more options than Birga Gateway can offer, you can create an application that is built into the management console and adds functionality to it. You do not need to switch different websites—you have all in one place. 
- **A chat with the floor section employees**. The owner writes in the management console about an incentive program updates and the location news. The message comes to the register; every cashier should check it out.

### Platform Functionality

- **Make API requests.** You can get any data from a Birga Gateway account, create products, dishes, and 
- **Embed an application in a POS register.** The platform allows you to create add-in programs for waiters and location employees
- **Embed in the management console.** You can add the functionality to the Birga Gateway back office by embedding your application directly into the management console. 

### Getting started

If you write an application for yourself only or explore the platform, use a Personal Integration token in your account in the Access → Integrations section.

If you write an application for Birga Gateway customers, you need to create a **Birga Gateway app**. **Birga Gateway app** is a Birga Gateway application profile. 
You will use it to work in the system through and will be able to publish and sell your application in our [Marketplace](#part-d79420499e308168).
